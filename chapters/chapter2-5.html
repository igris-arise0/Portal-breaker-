PORTAL BREAKER
CHAPTER 2 — “THE WEIGHT 
OF A NAME” (CONTINUED)


Scene 6 – Edge of the Frost Zone

The road toward the portal 
was almost empty.

Streetlights flickered like 
tired eyes.

Barricades blocked the main 
avenue—yellow tape, military 
trucks, Federation drones 
hovering above like silent birds.

Aarav walked straight toward it.

A soldier noticed him first.

“Hey! Civilian area is closed!”

Aarav stopped a few meters away.

Cold air from the frost wall 
reached even here—unnatural 
winter inside a summer city.

Another officer approached, 
scanning him with a handheld 
device.

BEEP

“Power level detected: 2 Star.”

The officer frowned.

“Two star warriors aren’t 
authorized for A–tier entry. 
Go back to the shelter.”

Aarav looked past them—

at the giant white wall rising 
from the ground like a 
frozen moon.

“I just want to take a look.”

“Looking is also prohibited,” 
the officer replied. 
“This isn’t a playground.”


Scene 7 – Something Moves

One of the drones suddenly 
blinked red.

WARNING — OUTER FROST 
DISTURBANCE

The soldiers froze.

From behind the barricade, 
near the half-formed frost wall,

the ground trembled.

A crack opened—small, thin, 
like a wound.

Black smoke leaked out.

“Impossible,” someone whispered.

“Devils shouldn’t appear 
before three days.”

The officer shouted into 
the radio.

“Unregistered emergence! 
Request backup—”

The sentence never finished.


Scene 8 – First Contact

A hand came out of the crack.

Not human.

Too long. Too pale. Nails 
like broken glass.

Then another.

A creature dragged itself 
halfway out—

half-formed, unstable, as if 
the world itself didn’t want 
it here yet.

A Lesser Devil — 
Incomplete Form.

The soldiers stepped back.

“Open fire!”

Bullets hit the body—

they sank in like stones 
thrown into mud.

The devil turned its head 
slowly toward the nearest man.

And smiled.


Scene 9 – Aarav Moves

Before anyone could react,

Aarav stepped over the barricade.

“Hey! Come back!” 
the officer yelled.

The devil lunged.

Aarav didn’t draw the katana.

He simply shifted his weight 
and punched.

BOOM

The air cracked.

The creature flew backward 
into a truck, metal bending 
like paper.

Everyone went silent.

Aarav looked at his right hand.

No glow.

No lightning.

Just raw force.

The officer stared.

“Two star… my foot.”


Scene 10 – Realization

The devil twitched, trying 
to stand again.

Aarav finally rested his palm 
on the katana hilt.

“Stay back,” he told the 
soldiers without turning.

“This one isn’t meant 
for guns.”

The device on his chest vibrated.

2 STAR — UNSTABLE

He noticed it.

“Unstable… huh.”

The devil screamed and 
rushed again.

Aarav exhaled.

“Good.”
