PORTAL BREAKER
CHAPTER 1 — AFTER THE LIGHT


Morning came quietly.


Too quietly.


Aarav stood near the window
of his small apartment,
looking down at the street
below. The broken glass had
been cleared, but the cracks
on the road were still visible,
covered with yellow tape and
warning signs. Soldiers stood
at every major crossing.


“So it really happened,”
he muttered.


The TV behind him
was still on.


“—the Federation has
confirmed the appearance
of an A-Tier Portal late
last night. Officials assure
citizens that the situation
is under control—”


Aarav turned
the volume down.


Under control,
he thought.
That’s what they
always say.


He reached for the small
device on the table.
The metal was cold
as he clipped it
onto his chest.


2 STAR


The blue text lit up
softly.


“Still the same,”
Aarav said quietly,
letting out a
short breath.


He tied his shoes and
glanced at the katana
resting against the wall.
After a moment’s
hesitation, he picked
it up and secured it
at his waist.
Just in case.


His phone vibrated.


A single message.


FEDERATION NOTICE
All registered Warriors
are to report immediately.
No exceptions.


Aarav stared at the screen
for a few seconds.


“Tch…
like I had a choice.”


The Federation branch
was crowded.


Warriors filled the hall—
some standing in groups,
some sitting alone.
Chest devices glowed
everywhere.

1 STAR.
3 STAR.
5 STAR.


Aarav felt a few eyes
turn toward him
as he entered.


“Hey…
isn’t that guy
a 2 Star?”


“Yeah.
Why is he
even here?”


“Probably just
attendance.”


He ignored them and
leaned against
a pillar.


An A-Tier portal…

No way this
ends clean.


A voice boomed
through the hall.


“All Warriors,
quiet.”


A Federation officer
stepped forward,
his expression stiff.


“You already know
why you’re here,”
the man said.
“An A-Tier portal
has appeared inside
city limits.
Evacuation was
successful.
Casualties are—”


Aarav’s eyes
narrowed.


They’re lying.


The officer continued,

“Elite squads are
currently unavailable.
Until further notice,
all Warriors will
remain on standby.”


A murmur spread
through the room.


“What?”


“Unavailable?”


“An A-Tier portal
with no squad?”


Another officer
cut in sharply.


“This is not
a request.”


The room fell
silent again.


Aarav clenched
his jaw.


Standby?

You expect
that thing
to just wait?


Somewhere far away—
behind frost,
behind concrete,
behind lies—

a timer continued
to count down.


That night,
Aarav stood alone
on the balcony.


The city lights
flickered weakly
in the distance.


If no one
goes in…

Then people will die.


His right hand tightened
unconsciously.


He didn’t notice.
