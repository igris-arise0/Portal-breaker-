PORTAL BREAKER
CHAPTER 2 — “THE WEIGHT 
OF A NAME”

The rain had stopped 
before dawn, but the city 
still smelled wet.

Aarav opened the window.

Mumbai looked half-asleep—
gray buildings, tired lights,
a sky that hadn’t decided
if it was morning yet.

The device embedded near 
his chest gave a soft vibration.

2 STAR — STABLE

He stared at it for a second 
and let out a faint breath.

“Stable… right.”

Stable didn’t mean safe.

His right arm felt heavy again—
like something inside the 
muscles was waking up,
stretching, remembering.

From the kitchen came the 
sound of boiling tea.

Vihaan.


Scene 1 – Home

“Etta, tea’s ready!”

Vihaan placed the cup 
on the table.

Fifteen years old, but he 
spoke like he was older 
than most adults.

Aarav sat down, katana sheath 
resting beside the chair.

Vihaan glanced at the device 
on Aarav’s chest.

“Notification came last night.
A–tier portal.”

Aarav stayed silent.

“Federation warriors are all 
at an SS–tier site.
There’s no one here.”

The room felt smaller.

Vihaan lowered his voice.

“Will you go?”

Aarav took a sip.

“Only if the Federation 
orders it.”

Vihaan smiled weakly.

“Always the rule-following 
hero, huh?”

Aarav placed the cup down.

“I’m not a hero.”


Scene 2 – Federation Broadcast

The television turned on 
by itself—emergency channel.

A calm female officer 
appeared on screen.

“A–TIER PORTAL CONFIRMED.
All civilians must remain 
in shelters.
Entry into the frost zone 
is strictly prohibited.”

Live footage showed the 
frost wall growing—
a white, unnatural barrier 
surrounding the cracked ground.

Vihaan whispered,

“Three days… that’s when 
they come out, right?”

Aarav thought to himself:

Three days isn’t safety.

It’s just a countdown.


Scene 3 – Aarav’s Mind

He stepped onto the balcony.

Parents—gone three years ago.

Same kind of portal.

Same announcements.

Same promises.

“We will protect you.”

But they didn’t.

His right hand clenched.

The skin looked normal—
yet beneath it, faint lines 
like hidden cracks.

He exhaled.

“Not again.”


Scene 4 – Sen

Phone vibrated.

SEN CALLING

Aarav answered.

“Bro, still alive?” Sen laughed.

“Unfortunately.”

“Good. If you were dead,
I’d kill you myself.”

Train noise in the background.

Sen continued,

“Federation’s in panic mode.

They’re calling it A–tier,
but the energy reading 
is strange.”

“Strange how?”

“Too calm.

Devils are usually restless 
near emergence.

This one feels… like a 
sleeping monster.”

Aarav stayed quiet.

“Did you go near the area?” 
Sen asked.

“No.”

“Don’t.

This isn’t a normal portal.”

The call ended.


Scene 5 – Decision

Vihaan had been listening 
from the doorway.

“That was Sen chettan, right?”

Aarav nodded.

Vihaan hesitated.

“Etta… if you go,
I’ll be scared.”

Aarav didn’t answer.

He picked up the katana 
and fixed it at his waist.

The device vibrated again.

2 STAR — STABLE

Through the window, the frost 
wall glowed in the distance.

Aarav spoke quietly,

“The one who’s scared…
is me, Vihaan.”

He walked out.

The door closed.


Final Lines

City lights began shutting down.

Doors locked.

People hid.

But one man walked 
toward the frost.

Aarav wasn’t going to 
save the city.

He was going to test himself.
