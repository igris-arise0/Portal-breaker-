PORTAL BREAKER
CHAPTER 3 — “MEAT AND IRON”
Scene 1 – The Collision

The devil didn’t run. It flew at
him like a missile.

Aarav didn’t have time to draw his
sword. He barely crossed his arms
before the creature slammed into
him.

CRUNCH.

It felt like being hit by a truck.

Aarav flew back and smashed into
the side of the overturned
vehicle.The metal door bent
around his back.Air exploded
from his lungs.

The devil didn’t stop. It pinned
him there. Its claws dug into
Aarav’s arms, tearing the skin.

It opened its mouth. Rows of sharp
teeth snapped inches from Aarav’s
face.

Scene 2 – The Sun Burns

Aarav roared and kicked the
creature in the stomach.

It stumbled back—just enough
to step out of the shadow.

The morning sunlight hit it.

SSSSZZZTT.

The sound was like meat touching a
hot pan.

The devil screamed. Its pale skin
instantly turned black and peeled
off in wet sheets. Red raw meat
steamed in the open air.

It shook with pain, throwing black
blood all over the road.

Aarav fell to the ground, coughing.
He spit out a glob of blood.

“Burn...” he whispered.

Scene 3 – Broken Face

The creature turned. Its eyes were
boiling, but it was still angry.

It rushed at him again.

Aarav drew the katana.

SHING.

He swung hard at its neck.

But he was too slow. The creature
slapped the blade away.

The heavy steel handle hit Aarav’s
face.

CRACK.

Aarav stumbled back. His nose was
broken. Warm blood poured down his
lips into his mouth.

The devil grabbed his shoulder. Its
fingers punched through his muscle.

It lifted him up and slammed him
into the road.

THUD.

Aarav’s head bounced off the
asphalt. For a second, everything
went black.

The devil raised a fist to crush
his skull.

Aarav reacted on instinct. He
jammed the handle of his sword
into the creature’s melting eye.

SQUELCH.

The eye burst. Black jelly sprayed
over Aarav’s hand.

The devil howled and let go.

Scene 4 – The Trap

Aarav scrambled up. He was dizzy.
He was bleeding.

He swung the sword again. Two hands.
Full power.

THUNK.

The blade cut deep into the creature’s
leg. But it hit the bone and got stuck.

The devil didn’t care. It grabbed the
sharp blade with its bare hand. It
pulled the sword, dragging Aarav closer.

Aarav let go of the sword.

He grabbed the back of the creature’s
head and slammed his forehead into
its nose.

CRACK.

He did it again.

CRACK.

The creature’s face caved in.

Aarav kicked it in the chest—right
in the center of the sun-burnt wound.

The devil fell back, screeching. It
realized it was dying in the sun.
It turned and ran toward the
dark alleyway, dragging the
sword still stuck in its leg.

Scene 5 – Into the Dark

“You don’t get to run,” Aarav
spat, wiping blood from his eyes.

He chased it into the alley.

The sunlight vanished. The air
became cold.

The devil ripped the sword out
of its leg and threw it away.

The wound on its leg started to
close. Grey fibers stitched the
meat back together. It stood up.
Its broken jaw snapped back into
place with a loud pop.

It hissed.

Aarav had no weapon.

The devil jumped at him.

Scene 6 – The Slaughter

Aarav didn’t back down. He
tackled it.

They crashed into the brick wall.

Aarav grabbed its throat and
squeezed. The devil clawed at his
ribs, tearing his shirt, cutting
deep lines into his skin.

Aarav slammed its head into the
wall.

BAM.

The wall cracked.

The devil tried to bite his face.
Aarav punched it.

Right in the throat.

GAK.

The devil choked. Aarav grabbed
its head and smashed it against
the bricks again. And again.

THUD.

THUD.

The creature went limp for a
second.

Aarav looked down. Half-buried
in the mud was a rusted iron
construction rod. Sharp. Ugly.

He grabbed it.

Scene 7 – The Pin

The devil saw the iron rod.
It tried to crawl away.

Aarav stepped on its knee.

SNAP.

The leg broke.

Aarav raised the rod high.

“Die.”

He drove it down.

SHHHK-CHUNK.

The rod punched through the
creature’s shoulder and pinned
it to the wet ground.

The devil gagged, spitting black
slime onto Aarav’s boots. It clawed
at the rod, but it was stuck.

Scene 8 – The Core

Aarav stood over it, chest heaving.


Blood dripped from his nose. Blood
dripped from his ribs.

He placed his boot on the creature’s
chest.

Beneath the torn skin, something
pulsed.

A faint, yellow light.

The Core.

It beat fast—terrified.

Aarav pressed his boot down,
crushing the ribs around it.

The devil froze, staring up at
him with pure fear.

Scene 9 – The Monster

Heavy footsteps echoed at the
alley entrance.

The Federation Containment Team
rushed in, guns raised, lights
cutting the dark.

“Freeze! Hands in the—”

They stopped.

The light fell on the scene.

The blood on the walls. The
black sludge. The broken sword.

And Aarav.

He looked worse than the devil.
His face was a mask of red blood.
His shirt was ripped. He was
leaning his weight on the iron
rod, driving it deeper every
time the creature moved.

The lead officer lowered his gun
slowly. He stared at the mess.

“You...” the officer whispered, his
voice shaking. “You beat it to death
with a piece of scrap metal?”

Aarav spat a mouthful of blood onto
the corpse.

He looked up. His eyes were cold.
Empty.

“It didn’t want to die,” Aarav said,
his voice rough.
“So I had to convince it.”
