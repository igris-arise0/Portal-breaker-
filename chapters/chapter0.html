PORTAL BREAKER
CHAPTER 0 — THE DAY THE 
SKY CHOSE A PLACE

Panel 1 
The night sky stretches
 endlessly above the city,
 dark and heavy. Thick clouds
 move unnaturally, not drifting
 with the wind but slowly
 being pulled toward a single
 point, as if the sky itself is
 folding inward. There is no
 thunder, no rain, no sound of
 wind—only an unnatural
 silence, deep and suffocating,
 as though the world is holding
 its breath. The clouds twist
 closer and closer, forming a
 quiet vortex in the air,
 unnoticed by anyone below.
                                             
                       2029

Panel 2
Far below the strange sky,
 the city continues its routine.
 Traffic flows through crowded
 roads, headlights painting long
 lines of white and red across
 the streets. Street vendors
 pack up their stalls, shop
 lights glow warmly, and
 people move through the night
 without urgency. Life goes on,
 ordinary and peaceful,
 completely unaware of the
 silent distortion forming high
 above.
 
      06/02/2029

Panel 3
Moments of normal 
life fill the street. A small
 group of people laugh together,
 their voices light and careless.
 A shopkeeper pulls down the
 metal shutter of his store, the
 familiar sound marking the
 end of another long day.
 Nearby, a child grips his
 mother’s hand and tugs
 impatiently, eager to get home.
 Everything feels safe.
 Everything feels normal.
 Nothing hints that this
 moment is about to become
 the last calm memory of the
 night.
 
        09:44 PM
       
Panel 4 
Without warning, the stillness
 above the city is torn apart.
 From the exact point where
 the clouds have been
 gathering, a single bolt of
 yellow lightning erupts
 downward, sharp and precise,
 like the sky itself has chosen a
 target. The lightning cuts
 through the darkness in
 absolute silence, flooding the
 streets, buildings, and faces
 below with a blinding yellow
 glow. For one frozen instant,
 shadows stretch unnaturally
 across the city, and everything
—people, cars, lights—exists
 only in that violent flash.

Panel 5

A heartbeat later, the sound
 finally arrives. A deep,
 crushing roar slams into the
 city, shaking buildings and
 streets alike. Windows burst
 outward in sharp explosions,
 glass scattering across the
 roads. Streetlights flicker
 wildly, some snapping off
 completely while others
 struggle to stay lit. The air
 trembles, and the ground
 vibrates beneath people’s feet,
 as if something massive has
 struck the world from above.

Panel 6 

At the exact point of impact,
 the earth begins to break.
 Thick cracks tear through the
 concrete, spreading outward
 in slow, deliberate lines. The
 ground does not collapse
 chaotically—instead, the
 fractures curve, forming the
 outline of a large circle. Each
 crack deepens, widening as
 though something beneath the
 surface is forcing its way
 upward, patiently shaping an
 entrance rather than
 destroying the land around it.

Panel 7
All across the city, phones
 react at the same instant.
 In pockets, bags, on café
 tables, and in people’s hands,
 devices vibrate violently,
 their sudden movement
 breaking through the shock
 left by the impact. Screens
 light up together, cutting
 through the darkness with
 cold white and blue light.
 The synchronization is
 unsettling—too precise,
 too coordinated to be
 coincidence.

Panel 8 

The screen displays a stark,
 emotionless message, stripped
 of any comfort or explanation.
 The words are clear, urgent,
 and final.

EMERGENCY ALERT

Portal detected.
Evacuate to nearest safe shelter
 immediately.

The message lingers on the
 screen, glowing steadily, as
 if waiting for the city to
 understand what it means.

Panel 9

Sirens erupt across the city,
 sharp and relentless, cutting
 through the night air from
 every direction at once.
 The sound overwhelms
 thought. Panic spreads
 instantly—people start
 running without knowing
 where to go, colliding with
 one another in narrow streets.
 Some freeze in place, staring
 at the sky or the cracked
 ground as if their bodies
 refuse to accept what their
 eyes have seen. Shouts
 overlap, footsteps echo, and
 fear takes shape in every
 movement.

Panel 10

Military vehicles flood the
 roads with brutal speed,
 forcing traffic to a halt.
 Barricades slam into place,
 sealing off entire blocks
 within minutes. Soldiers
 jump down, weapons raised,
 faces tense but disciplined.
 Above them, Federation
 drones lift silently into the
 air, their red and blue
 indicators blinking as they
 spread out in formation.
 Cameras lock onto the
 cracked ground below,
 recording everything, as
 the city is divided—those
 inside the zone and those
 desperately trying to escape it.

Panel 11 

From the cracked ground,
 the temperature drops
 suddenly, sharp enough to
 bite. Frost begins to spread
 outward, not exploding but
 growing with quiet precision.
 Ice crawls up through the air
 itself, forming a towering
 wall around the circular
 fracture, layer by layer,
 sealing the space within.
 Cold mist rolls across the
 street, swallowing sound
 and blurring shapes.
 There is no roar, no violent
 motion—only the steady,
 methodical advance of
 something designed to
 contain what lies inside.

Panel 12

One of the Federation drones
 hovers closer to the frost wall,
 its lens adjusting as data
 streams across its screen.
 A digital timer stabilizes into
 view, glowing sharply
 against the cold haze.

59:12.

The numbers begin to count
 down, second by second,
 indifferent to the fear below.
 Every tick feels heavier than
 the last, a silent reminder
 that whatever is sealed inside
 will not stay contained forever.

Panel 13

Beyond the frost, shapes
 begin to shift. Shadows slide
 along the inner surface of
 the ice, slow and deliberate,
 never fully revealing their
 forms. They do not rush.
 They do not test the barrier.
 Instead, they move as if
 aware of the time, waiting
 patiently, confident that the
 wall is only temporary.

Panel 14

A soldier stands near the
 frost wall, his boots planted
 firmly against the frozen
 ground. His hands tighten
 around his weapon,
 fingers locked so hard they
 tremble slightly. Cold air
 pours from the ice, turning
 his breath into short,
 uneven clouds, yet sweat
 rolls slowly down his temple,
 tracing a path along his cheek.
 His eyes never leave the frost,
 watching the shifting shadows
 behind it, knowing that
 training cannot prepare him
 for whatever waits on the
 other side.

Panel 15

Elsewhere in the city, far
 from the sirens and frost,
 rain begins to fall. Water
 taps softly against rooftops
 and empty streets, pooling
 along the sides of the road.
 Streetlights reflect in the
 wet asphalt, stretching into
 long, distorted lines. The city
 feels quieter here—almost
 peaceful—unaware that
 something has already
 changed forever.

Panel 16

Through the falling rain,
 a lone figure walks against
 the flow of the city. While
 others rush past him in panic,
 he moves forward with calm,
 measured steps. Rain runs
 down his hair and shoulders,
 soaking into his clothes, yet
 his posture remains steady
 and composed. Sirens echo
 in the distance, but to him
 they feel muted, as if the
 chaos belongs to another
 world.

Panel 17 

At his waist, partially hidden
 beneath his coat, the sheath
 of a katana rests securely
 against his side. The grip
 rises just enough to be
 visible, worn smooth from
 use rather than decoration.
 Rainwater slides down the
 black sheath and drips from
 its tip, each drop falling
 quietly as he continues
 forward.

Panel 18

His steps slow, then come to a
 stop. Rain continues to fall
 around him, pattering softly
 against the pavement.
 Without turning his body,
 he lifts his head slightly, as
 if responding to something
 unseen. His attention shifts
 upward, not in alarm, but
 with a quiet awareness—like
 someone who has felt this
 kind of disturbance before.

Panel 19

For a brief moment, a faint
 yellow light flickers across
 his eyes. It is not
 blinding—only a reflection,
 distant and diluted by the
 rain and darkness. His gaze
 remains steady, unreadable,
 as if the light confirms
 something rather than
 surprises him. The rain
 continues to fall, washing
 the glow away almost
 immediately, leaving his
 expression unchanged.

Panel 20

He lowers his gaze and starts
 walking again. His footsteps
 cut steadily through the rain,
 unhurried and controlled.
 He does not look back toward
 the light or the sirens behind
 him. Whatever has appeared
 in the city, he leaves it behind
 without hesitation, moving
 forward as if his path has
 already been decided.

Panel 21 (Close-up)

His right hand tightens slowly
 into a fist. Rainwater runs
 along his fingers and drips
 from his knuckles. At first
 glance, the skin looks
 completely normal. Only on
 closer inspection do faint lines
 appear across the
 muscles—thin, irregular
 marks, like natural cracks
 in stone. They do not glow,
 they do not move. They simply
 exist, quiet and unexplained,
 before disappearing again
 beneath the rain.

Panel 22
For a moment, something
 shifts inside him. Not a
 memory, not a vision—just a
 dull pressure deep within his
 right arm, like a weight briefly
 settling where it does not
 belong. The sensation is gone
 almost instantly, leaving
 behind only a faint heaviness,
 easy to dismiss yet strangely
 persistent. He does not react.
 The rain continues to fall, and
 the world moves on as if
 nothing happinesses.

Panel 23

The frost completes its work.
 The wall seals shut with quiet
 finality, smoothing over every
 remaining gap until the
 circular structure stands
 whole and unbroken. Cold air
 settles heavily around it, and
 the cracked ground beneath
 disappears beneath layers of
 ice. Whatever lies inside is
 now fully contained—hidden
 from sight, but undeniably
 present.

Panel 24

Near the sealed site,
 a digital board flickers to life.
 Its surface glows sharply
 against the frozen
 surroundings as letters form
 one by one.

"PORTAL RANK: A-TIER"

The words hang in the air,
 offering classification but no
 comfort, as those watching
 understand exactly what that
 rank implies.

Panel 25

Several Federation officers
 stand near the sealed site,
 their faces lit by the cold
 glow of screens and
 floodlights. They exchange
 brief looks—measured,
 restrained. No one speaks.
 There is no relief in their
 expressions, only calculation
 and concern, as if the ranking
 has confirmed something
 they were already afraid of.

Panel 26 

Inside the frost, far beyond
 human sight, something shifts.
 A shadow pauses, then curves
 slightly, forming the
 suggestion of a smile. It is not
 hurried. It does not test the
 barrier. It waits, patient and
 assured, as though time itself
 favors it.

Panel 27

Rainwater drips steadily from
 the end of the katana’s sheath
 at the lone figure’s waist. Each
 drop falls softly onto the
 pavement, barely audible
 beneath the distant sirens.
 He keeps walking, rain
 clinging to his clothes, leaving
 the sealed frost wall behind
 without once looking back.

Panel 28

The city skyline stretches
 endlessly into the night,
 rain-soaked and trembling
 under distant sirens. Far
 beyond the sealed frost wall,
 scattered across the horizon,
 faint yellow lights flicker
 one by one—on rooftops,
 between buildings, deep
 within neighborhoods still
 unaware of what they mark.
 Each glow pulses briefly
 before stabilizing, silent
 signals claiming their
 chosen ground. The sky
 remains heavy above them,
 clouds slowly gathering
 again, as if watching.
